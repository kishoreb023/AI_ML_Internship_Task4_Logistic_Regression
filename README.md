# 🧠 AI & ML Internship - Task 4: Logistic Regression Binary Classification

## 📌 Objective:
Build a binary classification model using **Logistic Regression** to identify whether a tumor is malignant or benign using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

---

## ✅ Key Steps:
- Data loading and exploration  
- Train/test split and feature scaling  
- Model training using Logistic Regression  
- Evaluation using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC  
- Sigmoid curve plotting  
- Threshold tuning discussion

---

## 📁 Files Included:
- `TASK-4_Logistic_Regression.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook containing the full code and outputs  
- `README.md` — Project overview and documentation  
- Dataset is loaded directly via `sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer()`  

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used:
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn

---

## 📈 Results:
- **Accuracy**: Over 95%  
- **Precision and Recall**: High on both classes  
- **ROC-AUC**: AUC score near 0.99 shows excellent classifier performance  
- **Confusion Matrix**: Very few misclassifications

---

## 🔍 What You'll Learn:
